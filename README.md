Finding the Tournament Champion Via Graph Data structure
Tournament Champions: Suppose that there is a tournament involving n players, where certain pairs of players play a single game against one another. We can then visualize the tournament as a directed graph, where each node is a player and there is an edge from u to v iff u played v and won her game against him.
